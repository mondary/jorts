## 1. Prerequisite

Please make sure you have these dependencies first before building Jorts.

* libgranite-7-dev
* gtk+-4.0
* libjson-glib-dev
* libgee-0.8-dev
* libjson-glib
* libportal-gtk4-dev
* meson
* valac

As of the current date (4th May 2026), here is the command to install on...

### elementary OS

```bash
sudo apt install elementary-sdk
```

### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install libgranite-7-common libjson-glib-1.0-0 libgee-0.8-2 meson libvala-0.56-0 libportal-gtk4-dev
```




## Setup Meson

### configure

It is recommended to create a clean build environment. Run `meson` to configure the build environment and then `ninja` to build
"cd" into the source folder, then

```bash
meson setup builddir --prefix=/usr
```

Once the building is done you can

```bash
cd builddir
```

then

### compile

```bash
ninja
```

### update translations

Update translation template

```bash
ninja jorts-pot
```

Update all languages following the template

```bash
ninja jorts-update-po
```

For extra text such as desktop file and metainfo, repeat but with extra-pot, extra-update-po



## Installing

Note that Jorts assume it is in a sandbox by default

To install, use `ninja install`, then execute with `io.github.elly_code.jorts`

```bash
ninja install
```

```bash
io.github.elly_code.jorts
```

you can also just run the binary in builddir if you do not wish to install

To uninstall, navigate to the same folder, then 

```bash
ninja uninstall
```
