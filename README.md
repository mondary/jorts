## 🦺 Installation

You can download and install Jorts from various sources:

[![Get it on AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/badge.svg?new)](https://appcenter.elementary.io/io.github.elly_code.jorts) 
[<img src="https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.svg" width="160" alt="Download on Flathub">](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.ellie_commons.jorts)


On Windows: Grab the Exe installer in Release
Not all releases have an exe, because bundling for Windows and testing it works is a HASSLE.

## 🛣️ The Future

The app is destined to stay simple. If anything there is already too much in the UI for my comfort, so do not expect /more/

Roadmap:
 - Document stuff
 - Fix an annoying memory leak where deleted notes linger in memory
 - Bin the whole saving infra and use Gtk 4.24 save-state new thing
 - More icon variants
 - Better list/bullets
 - Co-maintainers would be nice
 - More translations would be nice



## 💝 Donations

On the right you can donate to various contributors:
 - teamcons, the main devs and maintainers behind jorts
 - wpkelso, the author of the modern icon and its Pride variant
 - lains, the initial creator of the app (It was Notejot, now something very different)




## 💾 Notes Storage


Notes are stored in `~/.var/app/io.github.elly_code.jorts/data`
if from flathub, `~/.var/app/io.github.ellie_commons.jorts/data`

You can get it all by entering in a terminal:

```bash
cp ~/.var/app/io.github.elly_code.jorts/data ~/
```

"saved_state.json" contains all notes in JSON format. The structure is quite simple, if not pretty.

The app reads from it only during startup (rest of the time it writes in) so you could quite easily swap it up to swap between sets of notes.



ON WINDOWS: It's in:

YourUserFolder \AppData\Local\io.github.elly_code.jorts

AppData is a hidden folder. Either you paste the above path in the path bar, from your user folder
Or you do a "Show hidden files"
